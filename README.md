## IMPORTANT

**DO NOT SCAN DEVICES YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO**
OpenVAS and Nessus both try to access devices in various ways during the later stages of their scans.

OpenVAS will attempt a small ssh bruteforce attack on the server. If successful, you will have committed a felony under the CFAA*. Additionally, it will try to brute force FTP servers.

Nessus will attempt to screenshot VNC servers, and bruteforce FTP servers. These fall under the same as above.

**TL;DR: NEVER SCAN A DEVICE YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO**

`nmap` by default is fine though...

## Kali War Games VM

The provided template is a Kali 2018.3a VM pre configured with VM tools, Nessus, and OpenVAS pre-installed.

The username is `root` and the password is `toor` for the VM as well as Nessus. For OpenVAS, the login username is `admin` and the password is `c21f74bb-cb53-4ebc-b010-23a1d738c3a8`. **These webservers are configured to listen on all interfaces, so keeping this VM to share the same IP as your host device is highly advised.** Changing credentials is also suggested

You will have to provide your own key for Nessus. This can be obtained by going to [this link](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home) and registering for Nessus home.

Nessus will start on boot, and you can access it by going to http://localhost:8834/

OpenVAS needs to be started by running `openvas-start` in the terminal. A browser window will pop up when ready, but it can be found at http://localhost:9392
