# Red Team War Games

Welcome to the game.

The war games are a series of episodes in which each player or team is both the blue team and the red team for attack-defense style competitions.

## Episode 1: *The Wrapping of Cats*

## IMPORTANT

**DO NOT SCAN DEVICES YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO**
OpenVAS and Nessus both try to access devices in various ways during the later stages of their scans.

OpenVAS will attempt a small ssh bruteforce attack on the server. If successful, you will have committed a felony under the CFAA*. Additionally, it will try to brute force FTP servers.

Nessus will attempt to screenshot VNC servers, and bruteforce FTP servers. These fall under the same as above.

**TL;DR: NEVER SCAN A DEVICE YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO**

`nmap` by default is fine though...
